# SoC SPI Project
 
This project implements a SPI IP module on a Cyclone V FPGA, capable of being controlled and configured from the hard processor subsystem over an Avalon memory-mapped interface. Additionally, this project involved the implementation of Linux kernel modules to allow a user to write software to interface with the SPI IP module.
